# Worklog

Just a small bash project to keep a log of ticket replies throughout a shift and to build some familiarity with git.

```
(worklog) [-L] [-r] [-n] [-C] [-R] [-l] [-e] [-h n] -- display help for worklog
  where:
    -L login/logout 
    -r log a ticket reply
    -n log a note
    -C log monitoring alert claim
    -R log montioring alert resolution
    -l log lunch start/stop (will auto detect start/stop)
    -t review today's log enties
    -e manually edit log
    -h show this help contents
```
